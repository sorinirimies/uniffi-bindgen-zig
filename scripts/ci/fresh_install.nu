# ── fresh install: build the published crates the way `cargo install` does ─────
# CI builds with Cargo.lock; `cargo install` and library users resolve the
# dependencies afresh, from the packaged crate. A requirement that only works
# with the lockfile (v0.1.0 of uniffi-bindgen-zig asked for toml 0.9 while
# uniffi_bindgen took toml 1.x: two `toml::Value`s, and the crate did not
# compile) passes CI and breaks every install. So: package each crate in
# PUBLISH, unpack it, drop its lockfile, and build it with the newest
# dependencies its requirements allow.
#
# Usage: nu scripts/ci/fresh_install.nu
